# ServerMod for Distance
[Latest Release (.DLL)](https://github.com/Corecii/ServerMod/releases)

[ServerMod Help, Documentation, and README](https://github.com/Corecii/ServerMod/wiki) (recently updated)

This is a modified version of Nico's ServerMod from [here](https://github.com/larnin/Spectrum).

You need [Spectrum](https://github.com/Ciastex/Spectrum) to use this.

### Installation
1. Install Spectrum. You can get the latest Spectrum version from the pinned posts in the #modding channel of the Distance Discord.
2. Copy `ServerMod.plugin.dll` to `Distance/Distance_Data/Spectrum/Plugins`

### Features
* Auto mode: Run the server through your selected playlist automatically. Pause if there are no players. Shuffle the playlist when reaching the end.
* Autospec: Spectate automatically. Good for auto-hosting servers or going AFK.
* Put idle/afk players into spectate mode automatically with configurable idle timeout
* Voting: Voting to skip a map, stop the countdown, and play a level with configurable vote passing thresholds.
* Welcome message: Show a message to players when they join.
* Update checking: Show a message when you start a server if there are updates. This can be turned off.
* Manage the playlists without going to the lobby. Add to, remove from, and sort playlists in-game. Modify the current playlist or load any saved playlist.
* Stop the 60 second countdown.

## What is [Spectrum](https://github.com/Ciastex/Spectrum)?
Spectrum is a simple, yet powerful extension system for Refract Studios' game
[Distance](http://survivethedistance.com/)
It allows you to write DLL plugins to customize the game's experience and make it do things the original game's developers didn't even think about. It's being constantly updated by one of the Distance community members (sans small development breaks).
